            The perceived perversity of the universe has long been a subject of
            comment, and precursors to the modern version of Murphy's law are
            not hard to find.[citation needed] Recent significant research in
            this area has been conducted by members of the American Dialect
            Society. Society member Stephen Goranson has found a version of the
            law, not yet generalized or bearing that name, in a report by Alfred
            Holt at an 1877 meeting of an engineering society. <br><br>It is found that
            anything that can go wrong at sea generally does go wrong sooner or
            later, so it is not to be wondered that owners prefer the safe to
            the scientific .... Sufficient stress can hardly be laid on the
            advantages of simplicity. The human factor cannot be safely
            neglected in planning machinery. If attention is to be obtained, the
            engine must be such that the engineer will be disposed to attend to
            it.[1]<br><br> Mathematician Augustus De Morgan wrote on June 23, 1866:[2]
            "The first experiment already illustrates a truth of the theory,
            well confirmed by practice, what-ever can happen will happen if we
            make trials enough." In later publications "whatever can happen will
            happen" occasionally is termed "Murphy's law", which raises the
            possibility—if something went wrong—that "Murphy" is "De Morgan"
            misremembered (an option, among others, raised by Goranson on the
            American Dialect Society list).[3]

            American Dialect Society member Bill Mullins has found a slightly
            broader version of the aphorism in reference to stage magic. The
            British stage magician Nevil Maskelyne wrote in 1908: <br><br>It is an
            experience common to all men to find that, on any special occasion,
            such as the production of a magical effect for the first time in
            public, everything that can go wrong will go wrong. Whether we must
            attribute this to the malignity of matter or to the total depravity
            of inanimate things, whether the exciting cause is hurry, worry, or
            what not, the fact remains.[4]<br><br> In 1948, humorist Paul Jennings
            coined the term resistentialism, a jocular play on resistance and
            existentialism, to describe "seemingly spiteful behavior manifested
            by inanimate objects",[5] where objects that cause problems (like
            lost keys or a runaway bouncy ball) are said to exhibit a high
            degree of malice toward humans.[6][7] The contemporary form of
            Murphy's law goes back as far as 1952, as an epigraph to a
            mountaineering book by John Sack, who described it as an "ancient
            mountaineering adage": Anything that can possibly go wrong, does.[8]

            Differing recollections years later by various participants make it
            impossible to pinpoint who first coined the saying Murphy's law. The
            law's name supposedly stems from an attempt to use new measurement
            devices developed by Edward Murphy.[9] The phrase was coined in
            adverse reaction to something Murphy said when his devices failed to
            perform and was eventually cast into its present form prior to a
            press conference some months later – the first ever (of many) given
            by Dr. John Stapp, a U.S. Air Force colonel and Flight Surgeon in
            the 1950s.[9][10]<br><br> From 1948 to 1949, Stapp headed research project
            MX981 at Muroc Army Air Field (later renamed Edwards Air Force
            Base)[11] for the purpose of testing the human tolerance for
            g-forces during rapid deceleration. The tests used a rocket sled
            mounted on a railroad track with a series of hydraulic brakes at the
            end. Initial tests used a humanoid crash test dummy strapped to a
            seat on the sled, but subsequent tests were performed by Stapp, at
            that time an Air Force captain. During the tests, questions were
            raised about the accuracy of the instrumentation used to measure the
            g-forces Captain Stapp was experiencing. Edward Murphy proposed
            using electronic strain gauges attached to the restraining clamps of
            Stapp's harness to measure the force exerted on them by his rapid
            deceleration. Murphy was engaged in supporting similar research
            using high speed centrifuges to generate g-forces. Murphy's
            assistant wired the harness, and a trial was run using a chimpanzee.
            <br><br>The sensors provided a zero reading; however, it became apparent
            that they had been installed incorrectly, with some sensors wired
            backwards. It was at this point that a disgusted Murphy made his
            pronouncement, despite being offered the time and chance to
            calibrate and test the sensor installation prior to the test proper,
            which he declined somewhat irritably, getting off on the wrong foot
            with the MX981 team. George Nichols, another engineer who was
            present, recalled in an interview that Murphy blamed the failure on
            his assistant after the failed test, saying, "If that guy has any
            way of making a mistake, he will."[9] Nichols' account is that
            "Murphy's law" came about through conversation among the other
            members of the team; it was condensed to "If it can happen, it will
            happen", and named for Murphy in mockery of what Nichols perceived
            as arrogance on Murphy's part. Others, including Edward Murphy's
            surviving son Robert Murphy, deny Nichols' account,[9] and claim
            that the phrase did originate with Edward Murphy. According to
            Robert Murphy's account, his father's statement was along the lines
            of "If there's more than one way to do a job, and one of those ways
            will result in disaster, then he will do it that way." <br><br> The phrase
            first received public attention during a press conference in which
            Stapp was asked how it was that nobody had been severely injured
            during the rocket sled tests. Stapp replied that it was because they
            always took Murphy's law under consideration; he then summarized the
            law and said that in general, it meant that it was important to
            consider all the possibilities (possible things that could go wrong)
            before doing a test and act to counter them. Thus Stapp's usage and
            Murphy's alleged usage are very different in outlook and attitude.
            One is sour, the other an affirmation of the predictable being
            surmountable, usually by sufficient planning and redundancy. Nichols
            believes Murphy was unwilling to take the responsibility for the
            device's initial failure (by itself a blip of no large significance)
            and is to be doubly damned for not allowing the MX981 team time to
            validate the sensor's operability and for trying to blame an
            underling when doing so in the embarrassing aftermath.<br><br> The
            association with the 1948 incident is by no means secure. Despite
            extensive research, no trace of documentation of the saying as
            Murphy's law has been found before 1951 (see above). The next
            citations are not found until 1955, when the May–June issue of
            Aviation Mechanics Bulletin included the line "Murphy's law: If an
            aircraft part can be installed incorrectly, someone will install it
            that way",[12] and Lloyd Mallan's book, Men,

            Rockets and Space Rats, referred to: "Colonel Stapp's favorite
            takeoff on sober scientific laws—Murphy's law, Stapp calls
            it—'Everything that can possibly go wrong will go wrong'." The
            Mercury astronauts in 1962 attributed Murphy's law to U.S. Navy
            training films.[12]Fred R. Shapiro, the editor of the Yale Book of
            Quotations, has shown that in 1952 the adage was called "Murphy's
            law" in a book by Anne Roe, quoting an unnamed physicist: he
            described [it] as "Murphy's law or the fourth law of thermodynamics"
            (actually there were only three last I heard) which states: "If
            anything can go wrong, it will."[13]In May 1951,[14] Anne Roe gives
            a transcript of an interview (part of a Thematic Apperception Test,
            asking impressions on a drawing) with Theoretical Physicist number
            3: "As for himself he realized that this was the inexorable working
            of the second law of the thermodynamics which stated Murphy's law
            'If anything can go wrong it will'. I always liked 'Murphy's law'. I
            was told that by an architect." Anne Roe's papers are in the
            American Philosophical Society archives in Philadelphia; those
            records (as noted by Stephen Goranson on the American Dialect
            Society list, December 31, 2008) identify the interviewed physicist
            as Howard Percy "Bob" Robertson (1903–1961). Robertson's papers are
            at the Caltech archives; there, in a letter Robertson offers Roe an
            interview within the first three months of 1949 (as noted by
            Goranson on American Dialect Society list, May 9, 2009). <br><br>The
            Robertson interview apparently predated the Muroc scenario said to
            have occurred in or after June, 1949.[9] The name "Murphy's law" was
            not immediately secure. <br><br>A story by Lee Correy in the February 1955
            issue of Astounding Science Fiction referred to "Reilly's law",
            which "states that in any scientific or engineering endeavor,
            anything that can go wrong will go wrong".[15] <br><br>Atomic Energy
            Commission Chairman Lewis Strauss was quoted in the Chicago Daily
            Tribune on February 12, 1955, saying "I hope it will be known as
            Strauss' law. It could be stated about like this: If anything bad
            can happen, it probably will."[16] Arthur Bloch, in the first volume
            (1977) of his Murphy's Law, and Other Reasons Why Things Go WRONG
            series, prints a letter that he received from George E. Nichols, a
            quality assurance manager with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
            Nichols recalled an event that occurred in 1949 at Edwards Air Force
            Base, Muroc, California that, according to him, is the origination
            of Murphy's law, and first publicly recounted by USAF Col. John Paul
            Stapp. An excerpt from the letter reads: <br><br>The law's namesake was
            Capt. Ed Murphy, a development engineer from Wright Field Aircraft
            Lab. Frustration with a strap transducer which was malfunctioning
            due to an error in wiring the strain gage bridges caused him to
            remark – "If there is any way to do it wrong, he will" – referring
            to the technician who had wired the bridges at the Lab. I assigned
            Murphy's law to the statement and the associated variations.[17]<br><br>
            David Hand, emeritus professor of mathematics and senior research
            investigator at Imperial College London, points out that the law of
            truly large numbers should lead one to expect the kind of events
            predicted by Murphy's law to occur occasionally. Selection bias will
            ensure that those ones are remembered and the many times Murphy's
            law was not true are forgotten.[18] There have been persistent
            references to Murphy's law associating it with the laws of
            thermodynamics from early on (see the quotation from Anne Roe's book
            above).[13] In particular, Murphy's law is often cited as a form of
            the second law of thermodynamics (the law of entropy) because both
            are predicting a tendency to a more disorganised state.[19] Atanu
            Chatterjee investigated this idea by formally stating Murphy's law
            in mathematical terms. Chatterjee found that Murphy's law so stated
            could be disproved using the principle of least action.[20]

            From its initial public announcement, Murphy's law quickly spread to
            various technical cultures connected to aerospace engineering.[21]
            Before long, variants had passed into the popular imagination,
            changing as they went. Author Arthur Bloch has compiled a number of
            books full of corollaries to Murphy's law and variations thereof.
            The first of these was Murphy's law and other reasons why things go
            wrong!.[22] Yhprum's law, where the name is spelled backwards, is
            "anything that can go right, will go right" – the optimistic
            application of Murphy's law in reverse. <br><br>Peter Drucker, the
            management consultant, with a nod to Murphy, formulated "Drucker's
            Law" in dealing with complexity of management: "If one thing goes
            wrong, everything else will, and at the same time."[23] Mrs.
            Murphy's Law is a corollary of Murphy's Law. It states that things
            will go wrong when Mr. Murphy is away, as in this
            formulation:[24][25][26][27]
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">

          <p>
            Anything that can go wrong will go wrong while Murphy is out of
            town. <br><br>The 2014 movie Interstellar includes an alternate, optimistic
            interpretation of Murphy's Law. Protagonist Joseph Cooper says to
            his daughter, named Murphy, that "A Murphy's law doesn't mean that
            something bad will happen. It means that whatever can happen, will
            happen."
